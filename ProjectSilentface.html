                A 2D survival horror game.The game offers a tense survival experience where every challenge presents multiple solutions.
                 It emphasizes immersing players in a terrifying and unpredictable atmosphere, encouraging them to fully engage with the in-game world
                 . When players succeed in overcoming obstacles or defeating an enemy, they experience brief moments of relief. However,
                  the enemy is never truly goneâ€”it retreats, only to hide and return later. Exploration plays a key role, providing players with additional strategies for survival.

            <p class="project-description">
                A 2D survival horror game.The game offers a tense survival experience where every challenge presents multiple solutions.
                 It emphasizes immersing players in a terrifying and unpredictable atmosphere, encouraging them to fully engage with the in-game world
                 . When players succeed in overcoming obstacles or defeating an enemy, they experience brief moments of relief. However,
                  the enemy is never truly goneâ€”it retreats, only to hide and return later. Exploration plays a key role, providing players with additional strategies for survival.

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I was responsible for team management, storytelling, designing game mechanics, 
                and creating level designs to ensure a cohesive player experience.In design part I designed the monster AI behavior,
                the level layout, and how the guns function in alignment with the story and character development. 
                I provided detailed design briefs to the art team, enabling them to create characters as I envisioned.
                Additionally, I designed how each item functions and interacts with the environment, 
                determining where items should drop based on the game's pacing. 
                I also orchestrated when enemies would appear to hunt the player. Furthermore, 
                I crafted the game loop, ensuring smooth and continuous gameplay from start to finish.
                As a team manager, this was our first time using the Agile framework to complete a project.
                We created sprints to develop an early functional game for testing and to outline the tasks ahead. 
                To track progress, we asked team members four key questions: 1) What did you do? 2) What will you do next? 3) When will it be finished?
                4) Do you need help with anything? This approach fostered better communication, collaboration, and idea-sharing within the team.

        <h2>What I learned from this project</h2>
        <p>
            Testing from the build is more important than from the Editor, as performance issues like lag differ in the final build. 
            Frequent builds are needed to identify and fix problems early, preventing delays later. Using multiplication instead of addition for adjusting character abilities avoids 
            repeated value increases and simplifies management. A central variable should control all factors for easier handling. 
            Large projects come with challenges, so having backup plans is crucial. For example, delays in scene completion hindered item placement,
            causing a bottleneck in passing data to the coder and slowing the testing process.

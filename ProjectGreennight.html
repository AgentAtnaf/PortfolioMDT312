                <li>I define item stats such as rarity, trade value, disassembly value, and quality.</li>
                <li>I design how Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) responds to player actions, 
                    item interactions, progression, and player kills.</li>
                <li>I design the UI layout, detailing what elements should be included and how they should interact with the player.</li>
                <li>Developed the Main Spawner mechanics:Decided what to spawn and how many.and Determined which lane to spawn in and the delay between each spawn.
                </li>

        <h2>What I learned from this project</h2>
        <p>
            This project is still in progress, so I haven't learned much from it yet, but I did gain an important insight about time mechanics in games. 
            Time mechanics need to be developed carefully, especially if they are integral to multiple aspects of the game. For example,
            functions like fast-forward, time scaling, and timestamp checks need to work in sync with other systems. A timestamp function should return 
            true when a specific time is reached, allowing other functions to proceed smoothly.

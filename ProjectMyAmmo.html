                A 2D Tower defense.  The game's co-op experience is designed to challenge players to collaborate effectively, 
                making strategic decisions to navigate through chaotic situations. Players must manage their actions, considering the best course of action to 
                delay the advancing zombies. Resource gathering from warehouses during zombie attacks adds a layer of urgency, testing their ability to 
                balance offense and defense.

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>
            In this project, I served as both the Team Manager and Game Designer. I designed mechanics that required two players to collaborate,
             such as an item-gathering system where one player opens a box to spawn an item, which can then be carried but not picked up until unboxed.
              I also designed the mechanics for grenades, detailing their effects on enemies, and determined enemy types and how many would be sent to 
              the players. Additionally, I created level design layouts for the art team and communicated the core game mechanics to the developers.

        <h2>What I learned from this project</h2>
        <p>
            I learned that creating an online game is incredibly challenging, not only because you have to manage both the host and client but also due to the
             complexity of net code. Ensuring functionality on both sides is chaotic, which is why this project feels unfinished. Managing what the host and 
             client can do with the server was difficult. For example, in a simple item-gathering mechanic, the host could pick up items, but the client 
             couldn't. The UI was also confusing, with issues around which data to display, where to display it, and who could access it. Despite these 
             challenges, I gained valuable experience in online game development and how to design mechanics that foster true player cooperation for a 
             cooperative gameplay experience.
